# When set, the node will not allow more than one connection to/from a particular

PRIVATE_MODE=false

STARTER_DESO_NANOS=1000000

# A comma-separated list of 'prefix=nanos' mappings, where prefix is a phone
# number prefix such as \"+1\". These mappings allow the
# node operator to specify custom amounts of DeSo to users verifying their phone
# numbers based on the country they're in. This is useful as it is more expensive
# for attackers to get phone numbers from certain countries. An example string would
# be '+1=2000000,+2=2000000', which would double the default nanos for users with
# with those prefixes.
